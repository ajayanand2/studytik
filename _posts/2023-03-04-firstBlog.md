Anu is very happy because her father is coming back after two weeks’ long outstation trip. She is also happy for the fact that once her father comes back after his official trips, she gets to sleep with her grandmother. On such special days, she gets to hear many interesting stories from her grandmother. The grandmother is a treasure of stories: adventure, fairy tales, fables, ghost stories. What is wonderful about Anu is that instead of getting frightened she starts laughing when she hears stories about ghosts. Anu misses the company of her father on most of the days of a month as his job requires frequent travel. But once he comes back he does every trick in the book to make sure Anu does not get an excuse to complain about her father’s outstation trips. Similarly, he takes care of Anu’s mother and grandmother.
